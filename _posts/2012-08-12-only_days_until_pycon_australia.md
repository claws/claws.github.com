Yay, I'm going to PyCon Australia in Hobart! I even managed to get work to foot the bill as part of my professional development.
<!-- excerpt end -->

I'm really looking forward to the event for a number of reasons. The first reason is that I hope to learn new things about the language such as new libraries, tips, how others use it, etc, which might influence the way I use it at work and home. The second reason is that I have not been to an event like this before and I have not been to Tassie so it is all quite novel.

I spent a bit of time this weekend creating an information package and a plan of which presentations I want to attend.

I still need to organise myself a laptop. Hopefully I can source one from work.
