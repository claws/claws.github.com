            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Chris Laws. I'm currently working as a software integration engineer at a large defence contractor in Australia.</p>
            <p>My main educational background is a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (Honours) from Swinburne University in Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia.</p>
            <p>I grew up in the outer easter suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. I now live in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.</p>
            <p>In the little spare time I have at home, I have I enjoy reading and learning about new technologies. For example learning how to use Git/Github and making this blog is the outcome of one of those efforts :)</p>
            <p>I am also interested in various home automation technologies. I have written some software tools that help me monitor the environment around my home. Some of these can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/claws">github</a> user page.</p>
